# This file demonstrates how to print to the terminal
print("Hello World!")
# Note: Below python 3, the syntax was: print "Hello World"

# You can print pretty much anything, although how useful the output
# you get depends on how well whoever designed the data structure
# you're printing did at making the __str__ function (advanced topic)
