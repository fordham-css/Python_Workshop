# This file demonstrates variables in Python

# You don't need to use a 'var' keyword or declare a type
a = 1
b = "A string"
c = {"This is": "A dictionary", "It's pretty much":"the same thing as a JS object"}
# This is a list
d = [a, b, c]

# This is fine, types don't have to stay the same (well, mostly...)
a = b
